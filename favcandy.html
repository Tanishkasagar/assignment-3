        <h2>About Gummy Bears</h2>
        <p>Gummy bears are small, fruit-flavored candies that are loved by people of all ages. They come in a variety of flavors and colors, making them a delightful treat for any occasion.</p>
        <p>Join us on a journey to discover the magic of gummy bears!<br> The base ingredient of gummy candies is edible gelatin. It's also found in licorice, soft caramels, and marshmallows. Edible gelatin gives gummy bears their chewy texture and long shelf life.<br>Gummy bears made with bovine, porcine or piscine gelatin are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Those with porcine gelatin or from animals not slaughtered in either of the two contradictory ritualistic fashions do not conform to kashrut or halal dietary laws. In its factory in Turkey, Haribo produces halal bears and other sweets made with bovine gelatin. Also, some gummy bears are made with pectin or starch instead of gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians.</p>
